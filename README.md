# Players

*Please write here a few lines on the players you wrote.*
*Precise which choices you made, and why.*
*If you chose to create some functions, which ones and why?*
*What is the complexity of these functions?*
*Did you use defensive programming? if so, where and how?*

<In this file, 3 players have been created:
- Exhaustive
- Backtracking
- Sorted Neighbors
- Greedy
- GreedyEachCheese
- GreedyEachTurn
We were aiming at finding the shortest path to multiple cheese with the
most economical time cost.

Exhaustive:

Backtracking:

Sorted Neighbors:

Greedy:

# Unit tests

*Please write here a few lines on the tests you designed.*
*What are they testing?*
*Do you test some error use cases?*
*Are there some missing tests you would have liked to make?*
